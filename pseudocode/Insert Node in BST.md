### Insert Node in BST

- Make the root node as the current node
- If the node to be inserted < root

  - If it has left child, then traverse left
  - If it does not have left child, insert node here

- If the node to be inserted > root
  - If it has the right child, traverse right
  - If it does not have the right child, insert node here.
